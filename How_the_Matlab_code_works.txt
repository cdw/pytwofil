==========================
How the Matlab model works
==========================

# 'cluster_script_20090119' is called
	# A copy of the filaments to be worked on are created
	# 'startClusterJob_v3' is called with that set of filaments
	  and a set of paramters to evaluate
# 'startClusterJob_v3' takes over
	# The job manager is contacted and connected to
	# The cluster is polled to see what resources are available
	# The desired runs are split up as tasks amoung the free workers
	# 'runSim_v1' is passed as the function for the tasks to run
# So looking into each task, we see 'runSim_v1'
	# Initialize the random number generator
	# For each iteration of each run...
		# Reset the initial conditions
