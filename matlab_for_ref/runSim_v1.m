% CDW 20080117 - This is it, the lovely fellow that is going to take in some
%                inital conditions and information about how many times to look
%                over them and how long to do it each time, and return to you a
%                log of all that occured and the initial conditions again, I
%                haven't yet decided if it should save the output to disk or let
%                the parent script do that, but I am leaning towards letting the
%                parent do that
% CDW 20080521 - The parent does that
